I am a Full Stack Developer. I'm able to do scalable web projects using modern technologies like React, Redux, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize. I studied at SoyHenry's bootcamp where I learned new skills and improve my other skills. I also program in C# to desktop softwares development and for the game development industry, with Unity.
